

Install the following base packages:

# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils yum-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion kexec-tools sos psacct

Update the system to the latest packages:

# yum update
# reboot

If you plan to use the RPM-based installer:

    Install Ansible. To use EPEL as a package source for Ansible:

        Install the EPEL repository:

        # yum -y install \
            https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

       Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during later steps of the installation:

        # sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo

        Install the packages for Ansible:

        # yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible pyOpenSSL


Clone the openshift/openshift-ansible repository from GitHub, which provides the required playbooks and configuration files:

# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
# git checkout release-3.11
